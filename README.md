# hello-world

Hi, I'm sherm.
I'm new to programming, and have much to learn.
My main focus for now is web-dev, and I'm starting with The Odin Project curriculum. As of right now, I only have an extremely loose grasp of HTML and CSS, but I'm hoping to get skilled enough to be employed in the field eventually. If you're reading this, I hope it's because I've made a good impact on something we're working on or worked on together, or I made something that was useful or impressive to you.
